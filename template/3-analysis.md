# Analysis of the Situation
In Switzerland, hiking is a highly popular activity, drawing both locals and millions of tourists annually to its breathtaking landscapes and stunning vistas. The allure of Switzerland's natural beauty makes hiking an integral part of the outdoor experience for visitors and residents alike. However not everyone in the mountains is an experienced hiker who knows what they are doing, so its not rare to have someone come up without the basic first aid supplies, or even worse injure themselves.

*What are the competing products in the market today?*
In the current market, several competing products cater to the needs of hikers and outdoor enthusiasts. Notable competitors include established hiking apps offering route planning, trail maps, and navigation features. However, no one is really looking into helping treat the minor injuries of hikers, or improving their quality of hike, when they come underprepared.
*What are the complementary products in the market today?*
Some complementary products would be apps such as **swisstopo**, **Strava**, lots of hiking GPS products also tend to have their own route planning and tracking features. An obvous example of a complementary products would be the drones, an increase in drone purchases might mean an operator increase within our app. 
All of these are products that promote going out and hiking, but none of them really focus on the safety aspect of hiking, as depending on where you're going you could easily get some small cuts on your legs/arms or accidentally touch a stinging plant.
