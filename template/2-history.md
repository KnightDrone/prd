# History

Our proof of concept (POC) developed over the duration of this course contained the core features of the app. It included account creation flows, a map for both hikers and operators, a menu for ordering an item and viewing order history, as well as an AI chatbot and settings pages. On the operator side, the POC had functionality for accepting or rejecting orders. It also included a mix of online and offline features, with an offline guide as well as giving users the ability to download parts of the map. 

To reach the MVP, all we need is to get some operators, which initially will most likely be members of the team before signing outsiders up. The operators will need a drone as well as items that need to pass certain standards set by us. Regarding software, there are many features in our future plans, however none of them necessary to launch an MVP.
