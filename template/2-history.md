# History

Our proof of concept (POC) developed over the duration of this course contained the core features of the app. It included account creation flows, a map for both hikers and operators, a menu for ordering an item and viewing order history, as well as an AI chatbot and settings pages. On the operator side, the POC had functionality for accepting or rejecting orders. It also included a mix of online and offline features, with an offline guide as well as giving users the ability to download parts of the map. 

The development process introduced many new concepts to the team in technical and management topics. We learned full stack development using React Native and Expo Go, as well as how to make full use of GitHub's extensive functionality. In addition, this development process exposed us to concepts in user experience, giving us insight into making an app intuitive to use. Moreover, the SCRUM process itself taught the team a great deal on organization and planning, allowing us to optimize our time and work more efficiently.

To reach the MVP, all we need is to get some operators, which initially will most likely be members of the team before signing outsiders up. The operators will need a drone as well as items that need to pass certain standards set by us. Regarding software, we will monitor where the most calls to the database are made so that we can introduce a caching strategy to improve performance when rolling out. Also, there are many features in our future plans, however none of them necessary to launch an MVP.
